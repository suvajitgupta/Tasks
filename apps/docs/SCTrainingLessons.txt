- Stick to SC coding conventions, use SC doc tags
- Access controllers directly, not via get() calls - they are just namespaces, not properties
- Don't call out literals outside of the create() method
- Ensure @scope & @extend for all files
- Kill all require sc_require('core'); statements
- Named hashes are strange in SC - find other ways instead
- Minimize use of .observes()
- Don't put view properties or actions in controllers
- Don't get('content') from controllers (e.g., as in exportData)
- Ensure bindings are of the form 'Namespace.Object.Property'
- Layouts should always have 4 properties
- Use firstTime attribute of render() to be more efficient
- Use setClass() instead of addClass() - former more efficient (won't change if not needed)
- Use SC.Benchmark.start(key) & end(key) to profile/tune code
- Implement hotkeys as ctrl_shift_a() { ... }
- Always return YES from mouseDown()
- Use SC.TabView for Settings page
